\section*{\matlab{} alternatives}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\matlab{} alternatives}

When writing \matlab{} code, you need to realize that unlike C, Fortran, or
Python code, you will always need the \emph{commercial} \matlab{} environment
to have it run. Right now, that might not be much of a problem to you as you
are at a university or have some other free access to the software, but
sometime in the future, this might change.

The current cost for the basic \matlab{} kit, which does not include
\emph{any} toolbox nor Simulink, is €500 for academic institutions;
around €60 for students; \emph{thousands} of Euros for commercial
operations. Considering this, there is a not too small chance that you will
not be able to use \matlab{} after you quit from university, and that would
render all of your own code virtually useless to you.

Because of that, free and open source \matlab{} alternatives have emerged,
three of which are shortly introduced here. Octave and Scilab try to stick to
\matlab{} syntax as closely as possible, resulting in all of the code in this
document being legal for the two packages as well.  When it comes to the
specialized toolboxes, however, neither of the alternatives may be able to
provide the same capabilities that \matlab{} offers. However, these are mostly
functions related to Simulink and the like which are hardly used by beginners
anyway.  Also note none of the alternatives ships with its own text editor (as
\matlab{} does), so you are free yo use the editor of your choice (see, for
example, \href{http://www.vim.org/}{vim},
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}{emacs}, Kate,
\href{http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/}{gedit} for Linux;
\href{http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm}{Notepad++},
\href{http://www.crimsoneditor.com/}{Crimson Editor} for Windows).

\subsection{Python}

\end{floatingfigure}

Python is the most modern programming language as of 2013: Amongst the many
award the language as received stands the TIOBE Programming Language Award of
2010. It is yearly given to the programming language that has gained the
largest market market share during that year.

Python is used in all kinds of different contexts, and its versatility and
ease of use has made it attractive to many. There are tons packages for all
sorts of tasks, and the huge community and its open development help the
enormous success of Python.

In the world of scientific computing, too, Python has already risen to be a
major player. This is mostly due to the packages SciPy and Numpy which provide
all data structures and algorithms that are used in numerical code. Plotting
is most easily handled by matplotlib, a huge library which in many ways excels
\matlab{}'s graphical engine.

Being a language rather than an application, Python is supported in virtually
every operating system.

The author of this document highly recommends to take a look at Python for
your own (scientific) programming projects.


\subsection{GNU Octave}

\begin{floatingfigure}[r]{5cm}

\includegraphics[width=5cm]{figures/Octave_Sombrero}
\end{floatingfigure}

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with \matlab{}. It may
also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Internally, Octave relies on other independent and well-recognized packages
such as gnuplot (for plotting) or UMFPACK (for calculating with sparse
matrices). In that sense, Octave is extremely well integrated into the free
and open source software (FOSS) landscape.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary
functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and
differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via
user-defined functions written in Octave's own language, or using dynamically
loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.

GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software. You may redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) as
published by the Free Software Foundation.

The project if originally GNU/Linux, but versions for MacOS, Windows, Sun
Solaris, and OS/2 exist.

\subsection{Scilab}

\begin{floatingfigure}[r]{4cm}

\includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/scilab_official_logo}
\end{floatingfigure}

Scilab is a scientific software package for numerical computations providing a
powerful open computing environment for engineering and scientific
applications.

Scilab is open source software and originates from the French International
Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA).

Since 1994 it has been distributed freely along with the source code via the
Internet. It is currently used in educational and industrial environments
around the world.

Scilab is now the responsibility of the Scilab Consortium, launched in May
2003. There are currently 18 members in Scilab Consortium (Phase II).

Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions with the possibility to add
interactively programs from various languages (C, C++, Fortran,\dots). It has
sophisticated data structures (including lists, polynomials, rational
functions, linear systems\dots), an interpreter and a high level programming
language.

Scilab works under Windows 9X/2000/XP/Vista, GNU/Linux, and most UNIX systems.
Binary versions for these systems are freely available, along with the source
code.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical
computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed
parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function
library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature,
best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number
generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia
developer community is contributing a number of external packages through
Julia’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace. IJulia, a collaboration
between the IPython and Julia communities, provides a powerful browser-based
graphical notebook interface to Julia.
