This document is aimed at MATLAB(R) beginners who already know the syntax but feel are
not yet quite experienced with it. Its goal is to give a number of hints which enable
the reader to write quality MATLAB(R) programs and to avoid commonly made mistakes.

There are three major independent chapters which may very well be read separately. Also,
the individual chapters each split up into one or two handful of chunks of information.
In that sense, this document is really a slightly extended list of dos and don'ts.

This guide is written as part of a basic course in numerical analysis, most examples and
codes will hence tend to refer to numerical integration or differential equations.
However, almost all aspects are of general nature and will also be of interest to anyone
using MATLAB(R).
